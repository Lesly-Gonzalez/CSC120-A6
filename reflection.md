- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I enjoyed using inheritance in this assigment. In a way it helps keep my code more organized because I do not need to re write parts that are repetitive (all the building had a name, address and number of floors.)

I would advice them to carefully read the instructions. I initially felt overwhelmed about the amount of work we would need do for this assignment. Once I decided to start, I approaced it piece by piece, following the instructions from the README file.
